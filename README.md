# Reddit's 'Here's How to Prepare for Tech Interviews' solutions

# Data Structures
Go to wikipedia and read the whole page of each of these a few times, then write your own (for real, actually write the code and play with this stuff - that is the most important part)

Array
Linked List
Stack/Queue
Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc. Learn as many as you can)
Heap
Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means)
Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
Trie (pronounced "tree")
Linked Hash Map (this is very specific, but comes up a LOT in interviews)

You should know the Big-O for insert, delete, lookup, etc. for each of these

# Algorithms
Again, make sure you actually code these for real when practicing. Simply reading code someone else wrote will not cut it. Open up your favorite IDE and start typing. This is critical because often times you actually have a gap in your knowledge, but your scumbag brain convinces you it's ok (this happens without you even realizing it). The only way to find these gaps is by writing code. Know all of the Big-O for this and how it's derived.

You don't have to go crazy here, but review a couple of:

Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space. Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
All the prefix-tree searches

# Fill Gaps
This is where you get to be honest with yourself. That long list of things you don't know that you keep telling yourself is ok because the stuff you don't know isn't actually important....well, it is. Even if it isn't, your interviewer might think it is and it's better to have a job than be right. Here's a list off the top of my head that I hear people say isn't important (but you really should know).

Writing code - (I put this here half as a joke. I can't tell you how many people with 15+ years of experience lose their mind when I ask them tow write some code with me. These "architects" do not end up getting jobs. Same goes for managers and other support positions. I know that you're not going to write production code, that's fine - you should be able to write some code, though.)

Bits and Bytes - Yes, you should understand how all that bitshifting stuff works in whatever language you're going to interview with. You should know what big and little endian are. Do a couple practice questions, even simple one. Try something like..."write a method to determine if the bit-wise representation of an integer is a palindrome."

How the internet works. This applies more to companies....yeah....it applies to everything these days. You should know how sockets work, you should know what TCP/IP is. You should know what HTTP actually is. Learn your networking layers and what's responsible for what You don't need to know all of the details of the protocols, but you should know some of them and that they exist. This sounds daunting, it should only take a couple of hours.

Databases. Learn some basic SQL and data modeling if the job you're applying for uses databases.

Learn a bit about testing. Write some code and test it. What's TDD

If you've only ever used Windows....consider using linux for a bit.
